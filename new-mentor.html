title: Invite someone to become your mentor
---
<p>
You will be inviting a member
of staff to become your <strong>mentor</strong>. The member of staff must accept
your invitation before the relationship is recorded. You cannot yet tell us
about a mentoring relationship with someone who is not a member of staff.
